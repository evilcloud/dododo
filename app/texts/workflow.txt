Typically a first session is a new task creation with

new [message]

like:
new first task in the list


To check the list of tasks, launch the program with no arguments (or simply Enter in shell).


To change the status of a task

done [task id] [status]

like:
done aaaaaa Completed
or:
done aaaaaa
or:
done
or:
done Deferred

whe status is not provided, a default "done" status is assigned to the task.
when task id is not provided, the chronologicaly latest task is being addressed.
it is possible to assign status without assigning task id if the status is not the same as any of the task ids in the current
status must be a single word. any further words will be ignored and only the first one will be used
