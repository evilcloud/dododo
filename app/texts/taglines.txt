Embrace the impermanence of to-dos.
Tasks are fleeting; so is their burden.
Embrace the ephemerality of tasks.
No task is sacred.
Tasks are not milestones, just fleeting moments.
In the grand scheme, every task is but a blip.
Tasks are consumables, not keepsakes.
In the realm of things, expiration is liberation.
Tasks are not trophies; they're transient.
Tasks are not monuments; they're moments.
