Dododo: A CLI microtask manager designed for simplicity. It acknowledges the temporary nature of tasks, encouraging users to see them as short-lived actions rather than overwhelming commitments. With Dododo, tasks are tools, not treasures. They serve a purpose and then move on. In a world where life's chaos isn't always reflected in systematic methods, Dododo stands against the tyranny of productivity.
