# DoDoDo - a microtask manager ad reductum

## What is this?

A CLI microtask manager designed for simplicity. It acknowledges the temporary nature of tasks, encouraging users to see them as short-lived actions rather than overwhelming commitments. With Dododo, tasks are tools, not treasures. They serve a purpose and then move on. In a world where life's chaos isn't always reflected in systematic methods, Dododo stands against the tyranny of productivity.

## Why Haskell?

Because why the fuck not? It's a beautiful language, not terribly complex, and is almost guaranteed to work with no bugs, **_if_** you get it to compile. I don't really know Haskell that well at all, and I had heavily used ChatGPT to help me out. But so what? The architecture is mine, the hand-holding is mine, and the software is mine too.

## How to use it?

Tell you later, when I am done.
