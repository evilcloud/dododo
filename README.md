# DoDoDo - ephermal microtask manager ad reductum

## What is this?

DoDoDo is a CLI microtask manager designed for simplicity. It acknowledges the fleeting nature of tasks, encouraging users to view them as brief actions rather than daunting commitments. At their core, tasks are human-made constructs â€” set up to help us organize life's complexities. However, these arbitrary criteria often become tyrants of our attention, emotions, guilt, and distractions, pulling us away from the actual goals we set out to achieve.

With DoDoDo, tasks are tools, not treasures. They serve a purpose and then move on. Life is chaotic, and the strictness of tasks in such a world is absurd. This tool hopes to be a step towards liberation from the tyranny of productivity.

## Why Haskell?

Because why the fuck not? It's a beautiful language, not terribly complex, and is almost guaranteed to work with no bugs, **_if_** you get it to compile. I don't really know Haskell that well at all, and I had heavily used ChatGPT to help me out. But so what? The architecture is mine, the hand-holding is mine, and the software is mine too.

## How to use it?

Tell you later, when I am done.
